# My Personal Project

## Paige's Playlist

An example playlist:

###*Dance Yourself Clean from COVID-19*
"Like a G6" by Far East Movement
"Motley Crew" by Post Malone
"Low" by Flo Rida
"Ransom" by Lil Tecca

###What will the application do?
This application will store songs in named playlists. Users can add or remove songs to a 
specified playlist. Users can retrieve and view all songs located in a playlist. Users can 
play a playlist until there are no more songs remaining.

###Who will use it?
This application will be used by music listeners who want to create and play their playlists.

###Why is this project of interest to you?
As an avid music listener, this project is of great interest to me, so I can create, manage, 
and play music depending on the type of mood I am in. I can keep track of all my favourite 
songs so when I am on aux at a party it will be easy to keep the crowd entertained without
constantly thinking about what to play next.
