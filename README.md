###What will the application do?
This application will store songs in user-generated, named playlists. 
Users can add or remove songs to their playlists.
Users can view all songs located in their playlists.

###Who will use it?
This application will be used by music listeners who want to organize their music. 
Listening to music is a hobby that many of us have in common and can help people de-stress.
A playlist organizer is essential for music listeners who listen to music while doing other tasks.
This program will be especially helpful for people such as athletes warming up before a big game, 
hosts at a big party, and students commuting to school. 
In all of these situations, the person listening to the music is looking for a curated selection 
of their favourite songs, but they do not have the ability to select songs one-by-one at the moment
because they are preoccupied doing something else. 
This is why the music player application will be so useful for users in organizing and categorising 
their songs based on their mood and interests.

###Why is this project of interest to you?
As an avid music listener, this project is of great interest to me, so I can create and manage my music
depending on my current mood. I can keep track of all my favourite songs so when I am on aux at a party 
it will be easy to keep the crowd entertained without constantly thinking about what to play next.
